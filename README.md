2. Work on the task: You create a new branch in your local repository to work on the task: git checkout -b add-form-validation.
3. Make commits: As you progress, you make commits with messages referencing the issue: git commit -m "Add basic form validation #10".
4. Complete the task: Once the task is finished, you make a final commit that closes the issue: git commit -m "Complete form validation, closes #10".
